What is Ruby?
Ruby is a programming language created in 1995 by Yukihiro Matsummoto or "Matz".
It is an interpretor language not a compiler language.
It's syntax is like perl, python and smalltalk but it is more powerful than perl and more object oriented than python.


Why Ruby?
Ruby is fully object oriented. Every thing in the ruby is object.
Easily readble code like english.
Unsurprising syntax naming and behaviour.
No semicolons.


What is object?
Object is an instance of class.


Note:

Variable is not an object it simply stores object inside it.
EX: x = 2
x = variable
2 is an object.

When we divide an integer by an integer than we get an integer while in all other case we will get a float output.
EX: 10 / 3
# => 3
10.0 / 3
# => 3.33333333333333
10 / 3.0
# => 3.33333333333333
10.0 / 3.0
# => 3.33333333333333


Array is an ordered collection of objects. I can be accessed through index. It uses when the orders matters.


Hashes is an unordered collection of objects. It can be accessed through key value pair. It uses when labels matters.
